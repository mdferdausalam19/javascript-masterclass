    <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>

    <!-- Linking the JavaScript file with 'defer' attribute. 'defer' ensures the script will execute after HTML parsing is complete. We can also use 'async' in the <head> tag, but it will execute the script as soon as it's downloaded, possibly interrupting DOM parsing. -->
    <script defer src="./script.js"></script>

<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the JavaScript Masterclass.</h1>

    <!-- A simple div where we will inject text using JavaScript -->
    <div id="div-id"></div>

    <!-- 
        Alternative way (if we don't use 'defer' or 'async'):
        Place the <script> tag at the end of <body> to ensure HTML is loaded first.
